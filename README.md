# fraud-detection-and-prevention
## Overview
Fraud detection and prevention are critical in the financial industry to safeguard assets and maintain trust. Advanced analytics and machine learning techniques help identify fraudulent transactions in real-time, minimizing financial losses and reducing the risk of financial crimes.
## Objective: 
- Detect fraudulent transactions and prevent financial crimes using advanced analytics and real-time monitoring.
## Data Sources
- Transaction records
- Customer accounts
- External financial data (e.g., credit bureau data, market trends)
## Implementation Steps
### 1.	Data Collection
- Collect transaction logs, historical fraud data, and user behavior data from banking systems and external sources.
### 2.	Data Preprocessing
- Standardize transaction formats for uniformity.
- Handle missing or incomplete data entries.
- Balance the dataset by addressing class imbalances (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions).
### 3.	Feature Engineering
- Develop features such as:
    - Transaction amount and frequency.
    - Geolocation of transactions.
    - Time of transaction (e.g., unusual hours).
### 4.	Anomaly Detection
- Use machine learning techniques such as:
    - Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
    - Unsupervised Learning: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders.
### 5.	Real-time Processing
- Integrate the fraud detection model into transaction systems for real-time analysis and decision-making.
- Flag suspicious transactions and trigger alerts for manual review or automatic blocking.
### 6.	Monitoring and Maintenance
- Continuously evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Adjust fraud detection thresholds based on evolving patterns and feedback from flagged cases.
## Tools and Technologies
#### Python: 
- Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.
#### SQL: 
- For querying and managing transaction databases.
#### Apache Kafka: 
- For real-time transaction streaming and processing.
#### AWS: 
- For deploying machine learning models and managing infrastructure.
